  Trigger Bitrise workflow
summary: |
  Triggers a workflow on bitrise.io with specified parameters.
description: |
  The main purpose of this step is to trigger another workflow process of the same app, with the same build parameters, to achieve
  multiple workflows that all start on the same trigger. Optionally, we would like to do this in parallel and with different necessity of checks.

  For example: unit tests require a PR status check but mutation tests do not.
  However you can also provide modified build parameters, different Bitrise app and/or choose the same workflow.

  All the parameters except the workflow ID have default values equal to those in a current build. The workflow ID needs to be specified explicitly
  to avoid accidental infinite recursive triggers of the same build.
  You can use `$BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID` environment variable to get current workflow ID.

  See [devcenter](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/api/build-trigger/#build-params) for more information about build parameters.
  Specifying [environment variables](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/api/build-trigger/#specify-environment-variables) is not supported by this step.
